# kaizenkode_test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

dart run slang

dart run build_runner build -d

# note:

I should have used image_picker but because of gradle issue I couldn't so I continued without
it for the sake of time

I took care of some aspects that show a person's uniqueness more than the usual things. I hope you
take a good look at the code

There is some code that I didn't do (considered additional things) for the sake of time such as
organizing theme and responsive using screen_util
